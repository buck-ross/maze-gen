===========================================================================================

A CLI application to generate mazes & write them to XPM images files (or shared libraries).

By Buckley Ross <buckleyross42 at gmail dot com>

===========================================================================================

Usage:
	`maze-gen <file.xpm> <height> <width>`
	`make libmaze.so`

	<file.xpm>: You can call the file whatever you want, but the `make` rule to compile
		`libmaze.so` will only operate on a file named `maze.xpm`.

	<height>: This must be a positive, odd integer 3 <= n <= 2051.

	<width>: This, like <height>, must be a positive, odd integer 3 <= n <= 2051.

	`maze-gen <file.xpm> <height> <width>` is sufficient to generate a maze in XPM image
	format. The `make libmaze.so` step is purely optional, but can be useful if you want
	to make use of `maze.xpm` from a C program. `maze.h` is the corresponding header file
	for `libmaze.so`, and can be found under the `include` directory, along with all of
	the project's internal header files.

===========================================================================================

Building from Source:
	Once the source code has been downloaded & extracted, `make maze-gen` will compile the
	`maze-gen` program. No additional libraries are required for the program to run.

	`make libmaze.so` can be used to automatically build a 51x51 maze, write it to the
	`maze.xpm` file, & then compile the resulting maze into a shared library. If 51x51 is
	not the desired size, simply run `maze-gen maze.xpm <height> <width>`, before
	re-running `make libmaze.so` to re-build the shared library.
